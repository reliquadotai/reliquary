# Running a Reliquary Validator

Operational guide for running a validator on subnet 81. Both modes deploy via Docker.

## Two modes — pick one

| Mode | Who | Hardware | Auto-update |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weight-only** | recommended for almost every operator | CPU box, 4 GB RAM, no GPU | Watchtower polls GHCR every 5 min |
| **Trainer** | the Reliquary core team | A100 40 GB+ GPU, 64 GB RAM | manual (sensitive — never restart mid-step) |

While the network is bootstrapping there is exactly **one** trainer and the
core team runs it. Every other operator runs the weight-only mode, which
mirrors the on-chain weight signal from the trainer and earns validator
emission without any of the GPU cost or coordination overhead.

## Weight-only quickstart (5 minutes)

You need:

- A Linux host with Docker 24+ and the Compose plugin.
- A Bittensor wallet registered on netuid 81 (only the hotkey reaches this box — coldkey stays offline).
- R2 read credentials (the trainer publishes window archives to R2; you read them).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reliquadotai/reliquary.git
cd reliquary/docker
cp .env.example.weight-only .env
# Edit .env with your values (see "What goes in .env" below)
export BT_WALLETS_DIR=/home/you/.bittensor/wallets
docker compose -f docker-compose.weight-only.yml up -d
```

That's it. Watchtower will pull and restart your container automatically every time a new image is published.

### What goes in `.env`

The example file is annotated. The required keys:

```bash
BT_NETWORK=finney
BT_NETUID=81
BT_WALLET_NAME=<your-wallet-dir-name>     # under ~/.bittensor/wallets/<this>/
BT_HOTKEY=<your-hotkey-file-name>         # under ~/.bittensor/wallets/<wallet>/hotkeys/<this>

RELIQUARY_TRAIN=0                          # weight-only mode — DO NOT change

R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
R2_BUCKET_ID=reliquary
R2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

`RELIQUARY_TRAIN=0` is what makes this a weight-only deployment — the entrypoint reads it and starts in the right mode. **Don't change it to `1` unless you are the trainer.**

### Verify it's running

```bash
# Validator container is up and submitting weights
docker logs -f reliquary-weight-only

# Watchtower is polling GHCR
docker logs watchtower | tail -20
# Expect periodic "Checking containers for updated images" lines
```

## Trainer quickstart


You need:

- A GPU host with NVIDIA driver, CUDA 12.8+, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
- 1× A100 40 GB minimum, 64 GB RAM, 150 GB disk.
- A public IP and an open inbound TCP port (default 8080) — miners must reach you.
- HF Hub token with **write** access to your checkpoint repo.
- R2 **write** credentials.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reliquadotai/reliquary.git
cd reliquary/docker
cp .env.example.trainer .env
# Edit .env (see below)
export BT_WALLETS_DIR=/home/you/.bittensor/wallets
docker compose -f docker-compose.trainer.yml up -d
docker logs -f reliquary-trainer
```

Trainer-specific `.env` keys (full list in `.env.example.trainer`):

```bash
RELIQUARY_TRAIN=1
RELIQUARY_HF_REPO_ID=your-org/reliquary-sn   # HF repo to push checkpoints to
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx                              # write access to that repo
RELIQUARY_EXTERNAL_IP=<your-public-ip>       # advertised on-chain
RELIQUARY_EXTERNAL_PORT=8080
# Optional — resume after a restart so miners don't reset to base:
# RELIQUARY_RESUME_FROM=sha:<40-hex-hf-commit>
```


## Sanity checks (both modes)

```bash
# Health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# → {"status":"ok","active_window":42}

# State (trainer only — weight-only doesn't expose HTTP)
curl http://localhost:8080/state
```

For the weight-only mode, the only signal that things are working is the log line `Submitting weights: N miners …` once per subnet epoch (~30 minutes on netuid 81).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| `BT_WALLET_NAME is required` at startup | `.env` not loaded or variable empty. Confirm `env_file: .env` resolves and the file is in the same dir as the compose file. |
| Container restarts in a loop | `docker logs <container>` — usually invalid R2 credentials, missing HF token (trainer), or wallet mount path wrong. |
| Weight-only: no weight submissions logged | Check `validator_permit` in the metagraph. Without it, `set_weights` is a no-op. |
| Trainer: miners not submitting | Confirm `RELIQUARY_EXTERNAL_IP` matches your real public IP and the host firewall allows inbound on `RELIQUARY_HTTP_PORT`. |
| Trainer: high `WRONG_CHECKPOINT` rate sustained | Miners are not polling `/state` often enough. Brief spikes after each publish are normal. |
| Watchtower never updates | Check the `com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable: "true"` label survived your edits to the compose file, and that watchtower itself is running (`docker ps`). |
| HF publish failing (trainer) | Verify `HF_TOKEN` has write access: `huggingface-cli whoami` and try a manual `huggingface-cli upload`. |

For deeper protocol-level issues (high `GRAIL_FAIL`, batches not sealing, EMA drift), see [concepts.md](concepts.md) for the verification pipeline and reject reason reference.

## Security notes on the wallet mount

The compose files mount your wallet directory **read-only** at `/root/.bittensor/wallets`. Even if the container were compromised, it could not write to that path.

What goes there:

- `coldkeypub.txt` — public coldkey, fine to expose.
- `hotkeys/<your-hotkey>` — private signing key. Required.

What must NOT be there:

- The `coldkey` private file. Keep it on a separate machine entirely.

A safe layout: a dedicated `operator-wallets/` directory containing only the hotkey, with `BT_WALLETS_DIR` pointed at it. Your real `~/.bittensor/wallets` (with the coldkey) lives elsewhere.
